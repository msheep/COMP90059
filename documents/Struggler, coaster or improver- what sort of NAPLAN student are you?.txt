Has Australia become a nation of coasters?
The latest NAPLAN results have been published on the federal government's My School website, with some Victorian schools celebrating significant improvements, while others lag behind.
These schools are made up of three types of students: the big improvers, the coasters and the strugglers. Which one are you?
The big improvers
These students achieve above average improvements in literacy and numeracy. They are the black dot on the NAPLAN student report card that soars up the achievement scale as students move from year 3 to 5 and year 7 to 9. 
Every school wants to be a big improver, but according to Melba Secondary College principal Terry Bennett, it doesn't happen overnight.
In 2012, a food technology teacher at the disadvantaged school estimated that 40 per cent of year 10 students could not read a simple recipe.
Since then, Mr Bennett has trained his staff using a new model which sees teachers in every subject focus on reading and vocabulary.
