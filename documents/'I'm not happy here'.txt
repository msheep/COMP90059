This is not the retirement Shirley Mancer had hoped for during the many years she worked and brought up a family. In fact, it's much worse: she feels trapped.
Four year ago Ms Mancer sold her townhouse in Rowville and moved into a retirement village in Berwick, drawn by the promise of gardens, a renovated unit and a range of activities.
But she claims that when she moved into Aveo Edrington Park, she found the oven was unusable, a piece was missing from the cooktop, a curtain rail fell down and her dishwasher flooded and didn't work.Â 
Now, despite many complaints and legal action at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, Ms Mancer remains at the home for one reason: she can't afford to move out.
Because of the contract she signed it would cost her more than $100,000 in termination costs to leave, so the pensioner says she has little option but to remain.
"The people are lovely but I'm not happy here," she said. "This is not what I wanted during retirement, not at all."
