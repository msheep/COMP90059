Skye Whiteman's daughter Brydee was diagnosed with a rare childhood blood cancer at five-and-a-half months old.
An active child, Brydee had her bone marrow transplant in May last year, following six months of chemotherapy to treat her Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia.
Mrs Whiteman said her daughter slowed down a bit during treatment but "flew through" the transplant. Afterwards Brydee, now two, was one of the early beneficiaries of a new blood test.
The test which enables doctors to more accurately and rapidly assess the success of a bone marrow transplant has been hailed a lifesaver because of its ability to give doctors more time to respond to changes in a patient's condition.
Developed over five years by a team at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, it can detect whether the bone marrow transplant has been rejected, or if the disease is still present, much earlier than previous techniques.
Known as the Organ Health BMT test, it cuts the wait time for results from up to two months to within a week.
