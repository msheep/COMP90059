A young man with cerebral palsy who stabbed a five-year-old girl 25 times with a pocket knife in his Ballarat unit was drinking about a dozen stubbies of beer a day at the time of the attack, a court has heard.
The girl survived the attack, but, the County Court sitting in Ballarat heard on Tuesday, "the scars remain”.
Ty Ranger, 24, has pleaded guilty to one count of intentionally causing serious injury over the assault on November 22, 2015, and one count of possessing child pornography. 
Office of Public Prosecutions prosecutor Justin Burke said Ranger asked the girl into his unit and repeatedly stabbed her with a pocket knife before trying to remove her clothes. 
Mr Burke said the victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, bit Ranger on the lip before escaping.
She was taken to Ballarat Health Services Base Hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries.
"She has recovered from her physical injuries but the scars remain," Mr Burke said.
A few days after the assault, police also found two images of females aged between five and 12 on Ranger's phone in naked or sexually suggestive poses.
