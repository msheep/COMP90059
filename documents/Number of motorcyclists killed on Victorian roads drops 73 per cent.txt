A 73 per cent drop in the number of motorcyclists killed on Victorian roads could be because more motorists are looking out for riders on the road, a safety specialist says.

There have been five deaths so far this year, 14 fewer than at the same time last year.
In February last year 14 motorcyclists died on Victorian roads, the worst month for motorcyclist deaths in almost 30 years.
Transport Accident Commission Victoria senior road safety manager Samantha Cockfield  said losing so many riders over such a short period sent shockwaves through the community.
"The really high number of motorcyclists killed last year did shock not only the motorcycle riding community, but also motorists, who became so much more aware of how vulnerable motorcyclists are on the road," Ms Cockfield said.
"So I think drivers became more aware of their need to share the roads with motorcyclists and take care when there are motorcyclists on the roads. Everybody is recognising how vulnerable motorcyclists are."
