Sex shops, tobacconists and other shops selling synthetic ecstasy and cannabis will face big fines and up to two years in jail under tough new laws to be introduced to state parliament on Wednesday.
Growing concerns about the harmful effects of synthetic drugs - which have been linked to several deaths - have prompted the Andrews government to announce that any substance that has a psychoactive effect will be banned.
Police have been hamstrung by current laws which require authorities to categorise each specific compound or class of compound as an illegal drug. Manufacturers sidestep this approach by tweaking the chemical formula as more drugs are placed on the register.
Under the changes, which will bring Victoria into line with NSW and Western Australia, the effects of the drugs, rather than the specific chemical compound will be targeted.
Synthetic drugs have been linked to the deaths of three Victorians over a four-month period between 2013 and 2014, as well as numerous hospital admissions.
Under the changes, anyone caught selling such drugs will face up to two years in prison or more than $37,000 in fines.
