Besieged former deputy speaker Don Nardella should leave parliament altogether if he will not repay more than $100,000 he claimed for living in a seaside residence, a Labor MP says.
Labor's Anthony Carbines called for Mr Nardella to quit after he was booted from the parliamentary Labor Party for his claiming of allowances.
Police Minister Lisa Neville also backed that call.
"I know he's having conversations with the Labor Party as well. I think he needs to consider his own position," she told reporters. 
If Mr Nardella quit parliament there would need to be a by-election in his seat of Melton.  
Mr Nardella has refused to repay the $113,000 he claimed in the second residence allowance, which is designed to compensate country MPs who must travel to Melbourne for work.
But questions have also emerged about Mr Nardella's primary residence in Ocean Grove with the opposition suggesting the address may be a caravan park.
Ocean Grove is more than 80 kilometres from Mr Nardella's electorate.
When asked to comment on resigning from the Labor caucus, Mr Nardella said "f--- off" and "go away" on Tuesday. 
He has previously denied wrongdoing and said his allowance claims were legitimate.
