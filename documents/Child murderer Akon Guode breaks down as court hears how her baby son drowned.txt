Akon Guode, the woman who has admitted killing three of her children and trying to kill a fourth by driving into a lake, has broken down in court while a prosecutor outlined how her youngest child died.
About 40 minutes into her plea hearing in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, Guode began crying and put her head over her crossed arms on the desk in the dock.
The court was adjourned for 35 minutes. A counsellor helped her regain her composure.
Guode, 37, earlier this year pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, one of infanticide and one of attempted murder after she drove her car into Lake Gladman, in Wyndham Vale, on the afternoon of April 8, 2015.
Four-year-old twins Hanger and Madit and their baby brother, 16-month-old Bol, all died.
Their older sister, now seven, was rescued from the car and has since made a full recovery.
Prosecutor Kerri Judd, QC, told the court Guode drove her children past the lake four times in the hours before the car entered the water at 3.40pm.
