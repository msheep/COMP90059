Another 1500 apartments will be built on one of the last remaining undeveloped sections of Docklands, after Planning Minister Richard Wynne gave the nod to a five-tower project by developer Lendlease.
The development, which will consist of five towers rising more than 25 storeys each, will sit on a finger of land jutting into the Yarra at the far end of Collins Street.
It will feature a series of public parks. On completion the development, to be named Collins Wharf, will accommodate 3500 workers and residents.
The project was opposed by Melbourne City councillors last year.
A spokesman for Mr Wynne said the towers had been modified since then, getting shorter nearer to Bolte Bridge.
The $1.2 billion project will have a floating wetland, and its Yarra Walk will add more than a kilometre of public waterfront promenades.
Mr Wynne said the approval would "transform the Victoria Harbour precinct of the Docklands", and feature a large amount of parkland and open spaces.
"This is a carefully considered planning decision," Mr Wynne said.
He pledged that the approval for so many apartments would not be "at the expense of the city's great appeal".
